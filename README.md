# Decision Trees for Thematic Map Creation as Interactive 3D Scenes

This application allows the user to visualise decision trees for thematic map choice in a [three-dimensional scene](https://youtu.be/64YKQ40dd0o).
Either one of two examples can be chosen or an own decision tree can be uploaded. A .zip-file is available to ease up the conversion of decision trees into the format. This .zip file is available in the folder [tree-as-json](https://github.com/aurioldegbelo/3D4DT/tree/main/tree-as-json).

### Used Technologies:
The app was implemented using Node.js, Vitejs, Bootstrap and Three.js. 

### Run App:
Run `npm install` and `install vite`, before using the app. With `npm start` the app can be launched and is reached via localhost:3000. For further editing and testing use `npm run dev`.
